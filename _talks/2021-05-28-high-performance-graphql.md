One day you decided to give GraphQL a try and implement an API of your new application using GraphQL. You deployed the app to production, but after a while, you realized, that responses are not super fast. How to find out what makes your GraphQL endpoint slow?

Weâ€™ll discuss how queries are executed and what makes processing slower. After that, weâ€™ll learn how to measure performance in the GraphQL era and determine the part we should improve. Finally, weâ€™ll discuss possible solutions and some advanced technics to keep your GraphQL app fast!
