This talk will be helpful for people who do not have any production experience with GraphQL or do not see any benefits compared to REST.

We'll find out what is GraphQL, talk about it's philosophy and answer the following questions:

- how to use GraphQL query language?
- are there any things you cannot do with GraphQL? (spoiler - there are!)
- what is schema and why do we need it?
- how to write your GraphQL API in Ruby?
- what are best practices of GraphQL schema design?
