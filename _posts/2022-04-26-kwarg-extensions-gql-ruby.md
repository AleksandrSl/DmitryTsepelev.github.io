[graphql-ruby](https://graphql-ruby.org) comes with a builtâ€“in support for [field extensions](https://graphql-ruby.org/type_definitions/field_extensions.html). You can think of it as it were middlewares: a field that has an extension will be resolved only after passing the extension and only if extension explicitly allows that. An ability to halt the resolution can help a lot, for instance when you want to cache something (when cache is hit there is no need to resolve the field) or check permissions (when check failsâ€”we do not need to continue resolving).

> Have no idea what GraphQL is and why people love it? Check out my [tutorial](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/graphql-on-rails-1-from-zero-to-the-first-query) about GraphQL in Rails first

Imagine that we have the following schema with a single field we want to cache:

```ruby
class BaseObject < GraphQL::Schema::Object
end

class QueryType < BaseObject
  field :cached_val, String, null: false

  def cached_val
    "I'm cached at #{Time.now}"
  end
end

class GraphqlSchema < GraphQL::Schema
  query QueryType
end
```

Obviously nothing is currently cached, so when we call this field multiple times we will get different responses:

```ruby
query = <<-GQL
  query {
    cachedVal
  }
GQL

puts GraphqlSchema.execute(query).dig("data", "cachedVal") # => I'm cached at 2022-04-07 12:47:22 +0300
sleep 3
puts GraphqlSchema.execute(query).dig("data", "cachedVal") # => I'm cached at 2022-04-07 12:47:26 +0300
```

Here is the plan: when field is called for the first time, we will resolve it and remember the value, and use the cached one next time field is called.

> Our cache implementation will be very naive, please do not do it in your production app ðŸ™‚ I cache GraphQL responses using [graphql-ruby-fragment_cache](https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/graphql-ruby-fragment_cache)

Here is the implementation:

```ruby
class CacheExtension < GraphQL::Schema::FieldExtension
  def resolve(object:, arguments:, **rest)
    key = cache_key(object, arguments)
    store[key] ||= yield(object, arguments)
  end

  private

  def store
    Thread.current[:field_cache] ||= {}
  end

  def cache_key(object, arguments)
    "#{object.class.name}-#{@field}-#{arguments.hash}"
  end
end

class QueryType < BaseObject
  field :cached_val, String, null: false, extensions: [CacheExtension]

  def cached_val
    "I'm cached at #{Time.now}"
  end
end
```

Let's make sure it works (note that response is the same after 3 seconds):

```ruby
puts GraphqlSchema.execute(query).dig("data", "cachedVal") # => I'm cached at 2022-04-07 15:54:57 +0300
sleep 3
puts GraphqlSchema.execute(query).dig("data", "cachedVal") # => I'm cached at 2022-04-07 15:54:57 +0300
```

Looking good, but passing the array to the `:extensions` looks a bit cumbersome, and it will be even less readable when we decide to _configure_ our extensions. For instance, let's change our extension to support TTL (time to keep value cached):

```ruby
class CacheExtension < GraphQL::Schema::FieldExtension
  def resolve(object:, arguments:, **rest)
    key = cache_key(object, arguments)
    cached_value = store[key]

    if cached_value.nil? || ttl_expired?(cached_value)
      resolved_value = yield(object, arguments)
      store[key] = { value: resolved_value, cached_at: Time.now }
      return resolved_value
    end

    cached_value[:value]
  end

  private

  def ttl_expired?(cached_value)
    options[:ttl] && (Time.now - cached_value[:cached_at]) > options[:ttl]
  end

  def store
    Thread.current[:field_cache] ||= {}
  end

  def cache_key(object, arguments)
    "#{object.class.name}-#{@field}-#{arguments.hash}"
  end
end
```

This is how we'll have to configure the extension:

```ruby
class QueryType < BaseObject
  field :cached_val,
        String,
        null: false,
        extensions: [{ CacheExtension => { ttl: 3 } }]

  def cached_val
    "I'm cached at #{Time.now}"
  end
end
```

..and check that it works:

```ruby
puts GraphqlSchema.execute(query).dig("data", "cachedVal") # => I'm cached at 2022-04-07 16:29:50 +0300
sleep 1
puts GraphqlSchema.execute(query).dig("data", "cachedVal") # => I'm cached at 2022-04-07 16:29:50 +0300
sleep 3
puts GraphqlSchema.execute(query).dig("data", "cachedVal") # => I'm cached at 2022-04-07 16:29:54 +0300
```

In my opinion, passing kwargs for each extension would be a bit more readable:

```ruby
field :cached_val, String, null: false, cached: { ttl: 3 }
```

Is it possible? Yes, but we'll need to patch the initializer in our `BaseObject`:

```ruby
class BaseObject < GraphQL::Schema::Object
  def initialize(*args, cached: false, **kwargs, &block)
    if cached.is_a?(Hash)
      extension(CachedExtension, **cached)
    elsif cached
      extension(CachedExtension)
    end

    super(*args, **kwargs, &block)
  end
end
```

It's important to remove our custom keyword argument from `kwargs` to avoid passing it to the `super` call, because parent initializer does not expect it.

Here is a full listing that you can run and play with:

```ruby
require "bundler/inline"

gemfile do
  source "https://rubygems.org"

  gem "graphql"
end

class CacheExtension < GraphQL::Schema::FieldExtension
  def resolve(object:, arguments:, **rest)
    key = cache_key(object, arguments)
    cached_value = store[key]

    if cached_value.nil? || ttl_expired?(cached_value)
      resolved_value = yield(object, arguments)
      store[key] = { value: resolved_value, cached_at: Time.now }
      return resolved_value
    end

    cached_value[:value]
  end

  private

  def ttl_expired?(cached_value)
    options[:ttl] && (Time.now - cached_value[:cached_at]) > options[:ttl]
  end

  def store
    Thread.current[:field_cache] ||= {}
  end

  def cache_key(object, arguments)
    "#{object.class.name}-#{@field}-#{arguments.hash}"
  end
end

class BaseObject < GraphQL::Schema::Object
  def initialize(*args, cached: false, **kwargs, &block)
    if cached.is_a?(Hash)
      extension(CachedExtension, **cached)
    elsif cached
      extension(CachedExtension)
    end

    super(*args, **kwargs, &block)
  end
end

class QueryType < BaseObject
  field :cached_val, String, null: false, cached: { ttl: 3 }

  def cached_val
    "I'm cached at #{Time.now}"
  end
end

class GraphqlSchema < GraphQL::Schema
  query QueryType
end

query = <<-GQL
  query {
    cachedVal
  }
GQL

puts GraphqlSchema.execute(query).dig("data", "cachedVal") # => I'm cached at 2022-04-07 16:29:50 +0300
sleep 1
puts GraphqlSchema.execute(query).dig("data", "cachedVal") # => I'm cached at 2022-04-07 16:29:50 +0300
sleep 3
puts GraphqlSchema.execute(query).dig("data", "cachedVal") # => I'm cached at 2022-04-07 16:29:54 +0300
```

That's all for today! Hopefully this approach will help you to write more idiomatic GraphQL code in Ruby.

> Looking for a real world example of this trick? I have [one](https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/graphql-ruby-fragment_cache/blob/master/lib/graphql/fragment_cache/field_extension.rb#L8) for you

Fun fact: this post is based on my [gist](https://gist.github.com/DmitryTsepelev/065bb6bc796898f5745c4209d1b4bb21) created 3 years ago. At the middle of writing this post I decided to check docs and realized that this trick was added there two months ago, but I decided to keep going, cause my example is different anyway ðŸ™‚
